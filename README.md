# NG Space Company

Incremental space game about resource mining, interstellar exploration and system conquest

This is Sam!'s Fork of v1 of NGSC. It diverges from Freddec's final changes to V1, and adds fixes, refactors, and my own ideas of additional features.

You can play this version at https://x-sam.github.io/NGSpaceCompany/

If you wish to play offline, you can clone this repo, build it locally, and visit it in your browser.
